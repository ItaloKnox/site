Some annoying bugs around: Seems like the site flashes for a second when you load a page. I think it's the dark theme bugging out. I'll figure it out, sorry about that!

You might also know me as ItaloKnox, Radiata Alice or simply Knox. I've been a producer for almost 15 years, and a mix engineer for a little over half as long. Right now, I'm working towards shifting all of my work on mixing and producing vtubers. Since I'm passionate about music and vtubers, I feel like there's no better way than joining both things together. My mixes are known for their clear, present and spacious vocals, using my own developed technique over the years to minimize the use of compression and make sure your vocal stands out without feeling overcompressed. I'm incredibly passsionate about delivering a quality mix, and because of that, I'm very picky over the quality of my client's recordings. If you love to sing, and you are not afraid of receiving feedback and going back for another take, I would love to work together. About Radiata Alice Radiata Alice was created around 2014 as a circle (similarly to a band). Since I was also a game developer, the aim was to separate music from games from the start. Ever since then, Radiata Alice has been around up until 2023, when I decided to retire the circle with my last release: Hinamizawa Syndrome - Definitive Edition . Even though Radiata Alice is no more, my work as a composer goes on! Services Mixing ( available ) Mastering ( available ) Composing (check availability) Arranging (check availability) Tools Used (for nerds) DAW: Studio One 7 (always latest) Audio cleanup and restoration: SpecCraft, Soothe 2, iZotope RX, Spectralayers, Acon Acoustica 7, RePitch, Melodyne Mixing: Neve 1084, CL 1B, Clariphonic, UnFairchild, Sonnox, SPL Machine Head Mastering: smart:Limit, Master Plan, Kraftur, Neve MBT, Bettermaker Mastering Chain My work is a mix of digital and analog in places where it makes sense.

Try your best to include as many takes of your singing - this heavily shortens the delivery time in case you are not a professional. Make sure your takes are consistent (same style of singing, timing, etc). Original songs or recreated instrumentals Everything in the previous section; Ask your producer to prepare the instrumental and if possible, stems for backup. Also, if possible, ask to remove any limiting done at the master bus (they will know what I mean). Other details For fake harmonies, we can take two routes: Alternative takes: record a few takes of the sections where you want fake harmonies. Pitch is going to be corrected for the harmony. Quieter or more acoustic songs with lots of space for the vocal sound more convincing like this. Same take harmony: the final take of your singing will be harmonized - sounds less convincing since it originates from a single recording. Dense songs usually work well like this. Your vocal will always be tuned as best as possible while still sounding natural. The better you are, the better the results. Make sure you practice before (and not after) sending your recordings. Make sure that you know proper recording technique: Avoid clipping your microphone and make sure that your recording sounds as clean as possible. Do not apply effects or any mixing to the recorded track, unless you are tracking from outboard gear (such as a hardware channel strip).","title":"Information Guide"},{"location":"guide/#for-vtubers","text":"","title":"For Vtubers:"},{"location":"guide/#covers","text":"Make sure to have both your singing and instrumental in high quality audio - at least 44.1kHz/16bit (preferably 48kHz/24bit or higher) - WAV or FLAC only.

A discount up to 50% off can be offered based on availability, referral, budget or more. Don't be afraid of asking for a discount! I'm more than happy to give a discount if there's an opening. Pricing can change based on the size and complexity of the commission. No surprises, everything is discussed beforehand. No hidden fees. Your mix includes tuning, harmonies and anything else you need at no extra charge. Check the details in the section \"What should I know before commissioning a mix?\" For clients in Brazil, regional pricing is offered for local payment. Clients paying in other currencies are encouraged to discuss a discount if your budget is tight. Payment WISE transfers are preferred, but PayPal is also available at no extra cost - you can choose whichever you prefer. Payment is upfront most of the time, unless discussed otherwise. After the recordings are received and okayed, payment is expected to lock your spot. Once charged, the delivery time starts counting. In the case of multiple mixes, payments can be made per mix or at a rate discussed previously. Trusted clients (repeat customers, referrals, friends of friends, etc) can request more flexibility for this and the previous point if needed. Delivery Max delivery time is usually 14 days (will be confirmed before commiting). Rush jobs accepted - pricing will increase based on overall availability, deadline and complexity. Get in touch regarding your situation, I usually reply fast. I don't overcharge for reasonable deadlines! In case of any issues, the client will be notified at least 7 days before the deadline. Usually the initial delivery takes less than 14 days, but never more. What Will I Receive? A mix fully mastered in high quality, ready for release on YouTube or any common streaming platform. The same mix, but unmastered, in case you want to send it to another mastering engineer (this can be useful for compilation albums). Optional: your vocal mixed (same as the full mix and master), separate from the instrumental. About Revisions After the delivery of the mix and further confirmation from the client, you will have 7 days to request changes to the mix. The revision period does not stack with any leftover days from an early delivery! The client can request up to 3 revisions, potentially extended up to 5 if deemed reasonable - further revisions will be $10/revision. It is worth noting that the client must be reasonable in understanding that revisions, at a certain point, do not fix things anymore, they just make them different. Some issues are related to the production of the song, and not by the mixing. I usually do my best communicating any potential issues with the production and singing before payment, so that you don't waste your money and I don't waste my time working on something that will be ultimately unsatisfying for both of us.","title":"Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#payment","text":"WISE transfers are preferred, but PayPal is also available at no extra cost - you can choose whichever you prefer.
