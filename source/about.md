## Profile

Hello! My name is **√çtalo**. You might also know me as ItaloKnox, Radiata Alice or simply Knox.
I've been a producer for almost 15 years, and a mix engineer for a little over half as long.
Right now, I'm working towards shifting all of my work on mixing and producing vtubers.
Since I'm passionate about music and vtubers, I feel like there's no better way than joining both things together.

My mixes are known for their clear, present and spacious vocals, using my own developed technique over the years to minimize the use of compression and make sure your vocal stands out without feeling overcompressed.

I'm incredibly passionate about delivering a quality mix, and because of that, I'm very picky over the quality of my client's recordings. If you love to sing, and you are not afraid of receiving feedback and going back for another take, I would love to work together.

## About Radiata Alice

Radiata Alice was created around 2014 as a circle (similarly to a band). Since I was also a game developer, the aim was to separate music from games from the start.
Ever since then, Radiata Alice has been around up until 2023, when I decided to retire the circle with my last release: [Hinamizawa Syndrome - Definitive Edition](https://radiataalice.bandcamp.com/album/hinamizawa-syndrome-definitive-edition).

Even though Radiata Alice is no more, my work as a composer goes on!
