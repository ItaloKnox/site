!!! note "New site broke:"
    The new and fancy site I spent a while making has blown up in ways I can't really decipher right now. The most important stuff has been moved over here already, and in the meantime, I plan to keep rounding the edges. We're ugly, but at least we're working now!

!!! warning "~~Some annoying bugs around:~~"
    ~~Seems like the site flashes for a second when you load a page. I think it's the dark theme bugging out. I'll figure it out, sorry about that! In the meantime, you can switch to the light theme if that bothers you (it surely bothers me).~~

!!! note "Bugs fixed?"
    I have moved everything to a different theme that I'm more familiar with. Still kinda ugly, but at least that might fix the flashing issues.
