!!! note "Updates:"
    **2025-07-06**: Updated the mix for "Villain", previous one was a little too dark! Always bothered me a little, so I went and changed it.

!!! note "New site broke:"
    The new and fancy site I spent a while making has blown up in ways I can't really decipher right now. The most important stuff has been moved over here already, and in the meantime, I plan to keep rounding the edges. We're ugly, but at least we're working now!

!!! note "Bugs fixed?"
    I have moved everything to a different theme that I'm more familiar with. Still kinda ugly, but at least that might fix the flashing issues.
