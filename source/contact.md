# Contact

!!! note "For any inquiries, please e-mail:"
    > **music[at]italo.page**

After initial contact, by the client's request, it is possible to move to a different platform for talks, such as Discord or Twitter/X DMs. Discord is usually preferred, but it's your call to make once we get things going.

For friends of friends (referrals in general), the first step can be skipped directly to Discord, if that's your wish. Just get my contact from your referral and ask them to keep me in the loop. If you are unsure if you really want a mix, I usually recommend to just write an e-mail and we will take it from there.

Lastly, including your tracks with your initial contact makes things easier on whether or not I can pick it up for mixing. Of course, that's not a requirement if you are currently in the planning stages.
