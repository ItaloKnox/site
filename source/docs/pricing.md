* Rates for a mix and master starts at $100. **A discount up to 50% off can be offered** based on availability, referral, budget or more. Don't be afraid of asking for a discount! I'm more than happy to give a discount if there's an opening.
    * Pricing can change based on the size and complexity of the commission. No surprises, everything is discussed beforehand.
* **No hidden fees. Your mix includes tuning, harmonies and anything else you need at no extra charge.** Check the details in the section ["What should I know before commissioning a mix?"](guide.md)
* For clients in Brazil, regional pricing is offered for local payment. Clients paying in other currencies are encouraged to discuss a discount if your budget is tight.

# Payment

* WISE transfers are preferred, but PayPal is also available at no extra cost - you can choose whichever you prefer.
* Payment is upfront most of the time, unless discussed otherwise. After the recordings are received and okayed, payment is expected to lock your spot. Once charged, the delivery time starts counting.
* In the case of multiple mixes, payments can be made per mix or at a rate discussed previously. Trusted clients (repeat customers, referrals, friends of friends, etc) can request more flexibility for this and the previous point if needed.

# Delivery

* Max delivery time is usually **14 days** (will be confirmed before commiting).
    * Rush jobs accepted - pricing **will** increase based on overall availability, deadline and complexity.
        * Get in touch regarding your situation, I usually reply fast. I don't overcharge for reasonable deadlines!
* In case of any issues, the client will be notified at least 7 days before the deadline.
* Usually the initial delivery takes less than 14 days, but never more.

# What Will I Receive?

* A mix fully mastered in high quality, ready for release on YouTube or any common streaming platform.
* The same mix, but unmastered, in case you want to send it to another mastering engineer (this can be useful for compilation albums).
* Optional: your vocal mixed (same as the full mix and master), separate from the instrumental.
  
# About Revisions

* After the delivery of the mix and further confirmation from the client, you will have 7 days to request changes to the mix.
    * The revision period does not stack with any leftover days from an early delivery!
    * The client can request up to 3 revisions, potentially extended up to 5 if deemed reasonable - further revisions will be $10/revision.
    * It is worth noting that the client must be reasonable in understanding that revisions, at a certain point, do not fix things anymore, they just make them different. Some issues are related to the production of the song, and not by the mixing.

I usually do my best communicating any potential issues with the production and singing before payment, so that you don't waste your money and I don't waste my time working on something that will be ultimately unsatisfying for both of us.
